# breez

## what is breez
1. Selects the current line in the currently active application anywhere on macOS (Apple Notes, Gmail, Notion, Obsidian...)
2. Grammar fixes the sentence using GPT 3.5 Turbo
3. Pastes the selection

All of this happens by just tapping a single shortcut, so you can focus on the thoughts you want to convey instead of fixing typos!
It works much better than traditional autocorrection as it fixes a sentence within its complete context.
